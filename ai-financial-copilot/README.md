AI-Powered Financial Co-pilot üöÄA full-stack, demo-ready "Value-Added Service" (VAS) platform built with React, Firebase, and Google's Gemini API. This application acts as a personal financial co-pilot, offering enhanced security, intelligent expense management, and context-aware travel assistance.Note: This version is an all-in-one demo designed for showcasing capabilities. All core logic, including mock anomaly detection ("PyTorch Model") and Generative AI calls (Gemini API), is self-contained within the React frontend for ease of review and demonstration during interviews.‚ú® FeaturesThis platform integrates multiple AI-driven services into a cohesive user experience:üõ°Ô∏è Dynamic Fraud Shield (Travel Mode):Allows users to input their travel itineraries (location, dates).Utilizes a mock anomaly detection model (simulating PyTorch) that dynamically adjusts sensitivity based on the active itinerary.Effectively reduces false positives for legitimate travel spending while accurately flagging suspicious activity far from the planned location.Generates context-aware security alerts using the Gemini API.üí¨ Conversational Expense & Subscription Manager:Features a Generative AI chatbot (powered by Gemini) grounded in the user's verified transaction history.Automatically categorizes expenses and identifies recurring subscriptions (based on mock data).Allows users to ask natural language questions about their spending (e.g., "How much did I spend on Shopping last month?", "List my current subscriptions.").üß† Context-Aware Security Insights:When the anomaly model flags a transaction, the raw alert is enriched using the Gemini API.Presents users with clear, plain-English explanations for why a transaction was flagged, incorporating details like location mismatch or unusual spending patterns.Provides simple "Yes/No" verification buttons for quick user feedback.üìß Simulated Email Alerts:Includes a "Test Anomaly" button to simulate a high-risk transaction guaranteed to trigger the fraud shield.Writes alert details to a mailQueue collection in Firestore, mimicking how a production system would trigger backend email notifications (e.g., via Firebase Cloud Functions).Also queues an email alert when a user explicitly marks a transaction as fraudulent ("No, this wasn't me").üõ†Ô∏è Tech StackFrontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSSDatabase: Google Firestore (Real-time NoSQL Database)Authentication: Firebase Authentication (Anonymous Sign-in for demo)Generative AI: Google Gemini API (via gemini-2.5-flash-preview-09-2025)Environment: Node.jsContainerization: Docker, Docker Compose (Optional, for development)üì∏ Screenshots(Main Dashboard - Initial State & Travel Mode Setup)(Transaction Feed showing verified transactions)(Dashboard with Travel Mode active and AI Co-pilot Chat responding)(Transaction Feed displaying a flagged anomaly with AI-generated insight and verification options)‚öôÔ∏è Setup & InstallationFollow these steps to get the project running locally:Prerequisites:Node.js (LTS version recommended) installed. This includes npm.A Firebase project created.A Google AI (Gemini) API Key.Clone the Repository:git clone [https://github.com/Avi2099GIT/AI-Financial-Copilot.git](https://github.com/Avi2099GIT/AI-Financial-Copilot.git) # Updated URL
cd AI-Financial-Copilot/ai-financial-copilot # Navigate into the correct subfolder
Install Dependencies:npm install
Firebase Setup:Go to your Firebase project console.Authentication: Go to Build > Authentication > Sign-in method and enable Anonymous sign-in.Firestore Database: Go to Build > Firestore Database > Create database. Start in Test mode (allows reads/writes during development). Publish the following security rules under the "Rules" tab:rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own private data
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    // Authenticated users can write to the public mail queue
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/mailQueue/{document=**} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
Get Firebase Config: In your Firebase project settings (Project Overview > Project settings > General), find the "Your apps" section. Click the Web icon (</>), register an app if you haven't, and copy the firebaseConfig object.Configure Environment Variables:Create a file named .env in the ai-financial-copilot project root (where package.json is).Copy the contents of .env.example into .env.Paste your Firebase config object (as a single JSON string) into VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG.Paste your Gemini API Key into VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY.Example .env content:VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG='{"apiKey":"AIzaSy...","authDomain":"...","projectId":"..."}'
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...your...gemini...key..."
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the ApplicationDevelopment Mode (Recommended)Start the Vite development server (make sure you are in the ai-financial-copilot directory):npm run dev
