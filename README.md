# üí∏ AI-Powered Financial Co-pilot üöÄ

A full-stack, demo-ready **Value-Added Service (VAS)** platform built with **React**, **Firebase**, and **Google's Gemini API**.  
This application acts as a **personal financial co-pilot**, offering enhanced security, intelligent expense management, and context-aware travel assistance.

> **Note:** This version is an all-in-one demo designed for showcasing capabilities. All core logic, including mock anomaly detection ("PyTorch Model") and Generative AI calls (Gemini API), is self-contained within the React frontend for ease of review and demonstration during interviews.

## ‚ú® Features

This platform integrates multiple AI-driven services into a cohesive user experience:

### üõ°Ô∏è Dynamic Fraud Shield (Travel Mode)
- Allows users to input their travel itineraries (location, dates).
- Utilizes a mock anomaly detection model (simulating PyTorch) that dynamically adjusts sensitivity based on the active itinerary.
- Effectively reduces false positives for legitimate travel spending while accurately flagging suspicious activity far from the planned location.
- Generates context-aware security alerts using the Gemini API.

### üí¨ Conversational Expense & Subscription Manager
- Features a Generative AI chatbot (powered by Gemini) grounded in the user's verified transaction history.
- Automatically categorizes expenses and identifies recurring subscriptions (based on mock data).
- Allows users to ask natural language questions about their spending (e.g., ‚ÄúHow much did I spend on Shopping last month?‚Äù, ‚ÄúList my current subscriptions.‚Äù).

### üß† Context-Aware Security Insights
- When the anomaly model flags a transaction, the raw alert is enriched using the Gemini API.
- Presents users with clear, plain-English explanations for why a transaction was flagged, incorporating details like location mismatch or unusual spending patterns.
- Provides simple ‚ÄúYes/No‚Äù verification buttons for quick user feedback.

### üìß Simulated Email Alerts
- Includes a ‚ÄúTest Anomaly‚Äù button to simulate a high-risk transaction guaranteed to trigger the fraud shield.
- Writes alert details to a mailQueue collection in Firestore, mimicking how a production system would trigger backend email notifications (e.g., via Firebase Cloud Functions).
- Also queues an email alert when a user explicitly marks a transaction as fraudulent (‚ÄúNo, this wasn't me‚Äù).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation

Follow these steps to get the project running locally:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (LTS version recommended) installed. This includes npm.
- A Firebase project created.
- A Google AI (Gemini) API Key.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avi2099GIT/AI-Financial-Copilot.git
cd AI-Financial-Copilot/ai-financial-copilot
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

### Firebase Setup
1. Go to your Firebase project console.
2. **Authentication:** Go to Build > Authentication > Sign-in method and enable Anonymous sign-in.
3. **Firestore Database:** Go to Build > Firestore Database > Create database. Start in Test mode and publish the following rules under the ‚ÄúRules‚Äù tab:

```js
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can only read/write their own private data
    match /artifacts/{appId}/users/{userId}/{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    // Authenticated users can write to the public mail queue
    match /artifacts/{appId}/public/data/mailQueue/{document=**} {
      allow create: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

### Get Firebase Config
In Firebase Project Settings ‚Üí General ‚Üí Your apps ‚Üí Web, copy your Firebase config object.

### Configure Environment Variables
Create a file named `.env` in the project root and add:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_CONFIG='{"apiKey":"AIzaSy...","authDomain":"...","projectId":"..."}'
VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...your...gemini...key..."
```
